# Twittter-Copycat


This project will be as stated in the title a copycat of well-known social network giant. As the real one is quite an elaborated application, I won't be implementing all the features available on it, instead will focus in CRUD, user authentication, web-design, implementing gems never used such as Guard and ~~Likeable~~ Opinions.

Built with RoR ![Ruby](https://cdn.emojidex.com/emoji/mdpi/Ruby.png "Ruby"), CSS and JS

## Features

- [ ] CRUD for Tweeets
- [ ] User authentication using **Devise** gem
- [ ] Only Tweeets author can *edit or delete*
