# Twittter-Copycat


This project will be as stated in the title a copycat of well-known social network giant. As the real one is quite an elaborated application, I won't be implementing all the features available on it, instead will focus in CRUD, user authentication, web-design and implementing gems never used [see in gems list](#gems).

I will be following a tutorial by Web-Crunch for the basic structure and then will implement my own features to extend the functionality of the website.
